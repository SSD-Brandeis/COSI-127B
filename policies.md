## <u>Late Policy</u>
Every student is granted a cumulative allowance of 4 late days, serving as extensions for their individual assignments, and no penalties are incurred during this period. These late days can be utilized across various assignments. However, once the allotment of 4 late days is exhausted, a penalty of 20% per day is imposed on overdue homework assignments. 

## <u>Contact Policy</u>
LATTE/Piazza will be the preferred mode of communication with the instructor and teaching assistants (TAs) outside of class hours and student hours. Posts in Latte/Piazza will be responded to within 24 hours. Emails sent during weekdays should expect a response within 48 hours. Be aware that not receiving a response is not a valid reason to not hand in homework on time, so start your work early to make sure you have no questions. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to ask conceptual questions and start discussions through LATTE. Other students should feel free to answer any questions and participate in any discussions on LATTE. The instruction team will go through LATTE questions the same day that student hours are held.

## <u>Academic Honesty</u>
You are expected to be familiar with, and to follow, the Universityâ€™s policies on academic integrity. You are expected to be honest in all of your academic work. Please consult [Brandeis University Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.brandeis.edu/studentlife/srcs/rightsresponsibilities/index.html) for all policies and procedures related to academic integrity. Allegations of alleged academic dishonesty will be forwarded to Student Rights and Community Standards. Sanctions for academic dishonesty can include failing grades and/or suspension from the university. [Citation and research assistance](https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723) can be found on the [university library website](https://www.brandeis.edu/library/index.html).  

## <u>Accommodations</u>
Brandeis seeks to create a learning environment that is welcoming and inclusive of all students, and I want to support you in your learning. If you think you may require disability accommodations, you will need to work with Student Accessibility Support (SAS). You can contact them at 781-736-3470, email them at [access@brandeis.edu](mailto:access@brandeis.edu), or visit the [Student Accessibility Support home page](https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/index.html). You can find helpful student FAQs and other resources on the SAS website, including guidance on how to know whether you might be eligible for support from SAS.

If you already have an accommodation letter from SAS, please provide me with a copy as soon as you can so that I can ensure effective implementation of accommodations for this class. In order to coordinate exam accommodations, ideally you should provide the accommodation letter at least 48 hours before an exam.

## <u>Respectful Environment</u>
Brandeis University is committed to providing its students, faculty, and staff with an environment conducive to learning and working, where all people are treated with respect and dignity. Please refrain from any behavior toward members of our Brandeis community, including students, faculty, staff, and guests, that intimidates, threatens, harasses, or bullies.

## <u>Laptop Computer And Cell Phone Use</u>
To create a focused and distraction-free learning environment, we have implemented a no laptop/mobile policy during the class. This policy is aimed at maximizing student engagement, fostering active participation, and promoting a conducive atmosphere for effective learning. By minimizing the use of laptops and mobile devices, we aim to enhance the overall quality of the learning experience and encourage direct interaction with course materials and fellow students.

## <u>Use Of Generative AI Tools</u>
Faculty are encouraged to clearly explain course policies and procedures considering the use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. See the CTL Guidelines and examples of syllabi language for help or inspiration.
